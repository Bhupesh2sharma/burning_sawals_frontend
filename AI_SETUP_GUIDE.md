### 3. Usage Instructions

1. **Access the AI Generator**: 
   - Go to your admin panel
   - Click on the "ðŸ¤– AI Generator" tab

2. **Generate Questions**:
   - Enter a prompt describing what kind of questions you want
   - Select a genre/category
   - Choose an AI provider
   - Set the number of questions (1-10)
   - Click "Generate Questions"

3. **Copy Questions**:
   - Click the checkbox next to questions you want to copy
   - Use "Copy Selected" to copy multiple questions
   - Or click the ðŸ“‹ icon next to individual questions

4. **Add to Database**:
   - Select questions you want to add
   - Click "Add Selected" to add them directly to your database

### 4. Fallback System
If AI generation fails or you don't have API keys configured, the system will automatically show sample questions based on the selected genre. This ensures the feature always works.

### 5. Sample Prompts
Try these sample prompts to get started:
- "Create questions about travel and adventure"
- "Generate questions about personal values and beliefs"
- "Make questions about hobbies and interests"
- "Create questions about future goals and dreams"
- "Generate questions about favorite memories"
- "Make questions about food and dining preferences"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"API key not configured"**: Add the appropriate API key to your `.env.local` file
2. **"AI generation failed"**: The system will show sample questions instead
3. **"Model is loading"**: Wait a few seconds and try again (Hugging Face specific)

### No API Keys Required:
The system works without any API keys by using sample questions. You can still:
- Generate sample questions for each genre
- Copy and use these questions
- Add them to your database

## File Structure
